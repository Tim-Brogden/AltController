A significant update to the software, including the following changes.

- Added a program option to show a circle for the pointer indicator instead of a radial line. This is now the default. If you prefer the previous behaviour, select the Radial line option. See Tools – Options – Display tab.

It can also be used to cycle through a number of modes or pages. See Tools – Options – Actions tab.
- Added a program option to automatically stop ongoing Inside actions when the pointer moves outside a screen region or custom button. This is useful for automatically interrupting a list of actions separated by Wait actions, so certain actions are only performed when the screen region or custom button is hovered over for long enough. It can also be used to cycle through a number of modes or pages. See Tools – Options – Actions tab.
