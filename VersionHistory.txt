A significant update to the software, including the following changes.

It can also be used to cycle through a number of modes or pages. See Tools – Options – Actions tab.
- Added a program option to automatically stop ongoing Inside actions when the pointer moves outside a screen region or custom button. This is useful for automatically interrupting a list of actions separated by Wait actions, so certain actions are only performed when the screen region or custom button is hovered over for long enough.
